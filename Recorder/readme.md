This is the final lab. I created a naive recorder with GNU. You can open LED16PKU.ASM to learn how to manipulate led 16*16 array,
and you can learn how to record your vioce with microphone.
If you want to create something else, the file named REFERENCE can help. It contains several samples, electronic keyboard, elevator,
stepper motor for instance.
